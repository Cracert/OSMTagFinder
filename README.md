# OSM TagFinder

A search engine for OpenStreetMap tags. Uses TagInfo, translation services (german to english) and an own semantic net.

TagFinder was developed as part of a research project for the Geometa Lab (Prof. Keller) of the IFS 
at the University for Applied Sciences Rapperswil (HSR) end of 2014. 
The application is written in Python 2.7 and uses Flask as web framework. 

There's a demo prototype at http://tagfinder.herokuapp.com/ (in english and german) including and API running on a Heroku Cedar stack.
